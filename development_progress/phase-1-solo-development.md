## Common Development Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technical Pitfalls
- **Over-engineering**: Build only what you personally need and use
- **Perfect UI first**: Focus on functionality, polish during usage validation
- **Complex architecture**: Leverage Supabase features, avoid reinventing wheels
- **Premature scaling**: Don't optimize for users you don't have yet

### Product Pitfalls  
- **Feature creep**: Resist adding features not validated by personal use
- **Theory over practice**: Every assumption must be tested through real usage
- **Ignoring constraints**: Build features that respect real-world limitations
- **Generic solutions**: Solve your specific use case first, generalize later

### Process Pitfalls
- **Skip personal validation**: Don't share until you personally love using it
- **Ignore edge cases**: Test unusual scenarios you'll encounter in real use
- **Poor documentation**: Document decisions and setup for future reference
- **No usage metrics**: Track how you actually use the app vs how you planned

*Solo development success is measured by one metric: Do you consistently use and love your own app? If yes, it's ready for others. If no, keep iterating.*
