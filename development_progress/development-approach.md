# Development Approach Strategy
## üéØ Master Guide for S&C Program Generator Development

### üèÜ App Vision: Performance-Focused Program Generation
**The first S&C app that generates complete periodized training programs** (not just workouts) tailored to real-life constraints. Built on science-backed principles from Supertraining, Joel Jamieson's methods, and peer-reviewed periodization research.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Dynamic Program Generation**: Full periodized programs that adapt to real life - missed days, travel, equipment changes trigger intelligent program regeneration
- **Calendar-Based Workout Interface**: Multi-scale calendar view (day/week/month) where the calendar IS the workout management system
- **Sequential Completion Enforcement**: Users must complete prescribed days before accessing future workouts, maintaining program integrity
- **Event-Driven Periodization**: Programs reverse-engineered from target events with dynamic test scheduling and timeline adjustments
- **Context-Aware Equipment Management**: Multi-gym access networks with travel mode that regenerates entire programs, not just exercise substitutions
- **Lifestyle Integration**: Deep profiling including commute, work travel, family constraints, recovery factors
- **Performance Focus**: Trains for events/metrics with sophisticated analytics hierarchy, not aesthetics
- **Science-Backed**: Linear/undulating periodization from leading S&C literature with dynamic adaptation algorithms

### ‚úÖ Build Order: API-First ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Frontend

Based on 2025 best practices, we follow a **contract-first** development approach.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Principles

1. **Contract-First**: API design drives everything
2. **No Premature Decisions**: Don't choose UI libraries until APIs are defined
3. **Sequential Progress**: Complete each phase before moving forward
4. **Documentation-Driven**: Write specs before code
5. **Test Early**: Validate APIs before frontend work

## ‚úÖ Completed Prerequisites
- [x] Development environment setup
- [x] Supabase database connection
- [x] Version control (GitHub)
- [x] Project structure
- [x] Development approach defined
