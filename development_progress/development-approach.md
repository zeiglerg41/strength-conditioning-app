# Development Approach Strategy
## üéØ Master Guide for S&C Program Generator Development

### üèÜ App Vision: Performance-Focused Program Generation
**The first S&C app that generates complete periodized training programs** (not just workouts) tailored to real-life constraints. Built on science-backed principles from Supertraining, Joel Jamieson's methods, and peer-reviewed periodization research.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Dynamic Program Generation**: Full periodized programs that adapt to real life - workouts shift forward when skipped (no missed days), travel/equipment changes trigger intelligent program regeneration
- **Calendar-Based Workout Interface**: Multi-scale calendar view (day/week/month) where the calendar IS the workout management system
- **Sequential Completion Enforcement**: Users must complete prescribed days before accessing future workouts, maintaining program integrity
- **Simple Performance Tracking**: Basic performance feedback via modal notifications - target achievement rates, workout postponement frequency, intensity adherence
- **Event-Driven Periodization**: Programs reverse-engineered from target events with dynamic test scheduling and timeline adjustments
- **Context-Aware Equipment Management**: Multi-gym access networks with travel mode that regenerates entire programs, not just exercise substitutions
- **Lifestyle Integration**: Deep profiling including commute, work travel, family constraints, recovery factors
- **Performance Focus**: Trains for events/metrics with sophisticated analytics hierarchy, not aesthetics
- **Science-Backed**: Linear/undulating periodization from leading S&C literature with dynamic adaptation algorithms

### ‚úÖ Build Order: API-First ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Frontend

Based on 2025 best practices, we follow a **contract-first** development approach.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Access Instructions

### Remote Supabase Database
**Project URL**: https://gytncjaerwktkdskkhsr.supabase.co
**Connection Details**: Stored in `.env` file

### How to Query the Database

#### Method 1: Via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gytncjaerwktkdskkhsr
2. Navigate to Table Editor or SQL Editor
3. Run queries directly in browser

#### Method 2: Via Edge Functions (Recommended)
```javascript
// In any Edge Function
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', userId)
  .single();
```

#### Method 3: Via Node.js Script
```javascript
// Example: test-supabase-connection.js
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
require('dotenv').config();

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
);

// Query example
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('*');
```

#### Method 4: Direct SQL Connection (Admin Only)
- Connection string available in Supabase dashboard
- Use with psql, TablePlus, or other PostgreSQL clients
- Requires service role key for full access

### Testing Edge Functions
```bash
# Deploy function
supabase functions deploy [function-name] --no-verify-jwt

# Test with curl
curl -X GET "https://gytncjaerwktkdskkhsr.supabase.co/functions/v1/[function-name]/[endpoint]" \
  -H "apikey: [anon-key]" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [user-token]"
```

- **Modal Feedback System**: Simple notifications about performance patterns:
  - "You've postponed 3 workouts this week - consider adjusting your schedule"
  - "Great job hitting 9/10 target intensities!"
  - "You're consistently missing target reps - should we adjust the program?"
- **Performance Data Sources**: User profile (self-reported experience) + logged workout data (weights, sets, reps completed vs prescribed)

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Principles

1. **Contract-First**: API design drives everything
2. **No Premature Decisions**: Don't choose UI libraries until APIs are defined
3. **Sequential Progress**: Complete each phase before moving forward
4. **Documentation-Driven**: Write specs before code
5. **Test Early**: Validate APIs before frontend work
6. **Type Safety**: Always ensure TypeScript types are correctly defined before using them - undefined properties will cause runtime errors

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Prerequisites
- [x] Development environment setup
- [x] Supabase database connection
- [x] Version control (GitHub)
- [x] Project structure
- [x] Development approach defined

## üöÄ How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with** `01-api-design.md` - Define all endpoints
2. **Complete each document** sequentially
3. **Don't skip ahead** - Each phase depends on the previous
4. **Check off tasks** as you complete them
5. **Refer back here** for overall progress

**Remember**: Frontend can't exist without backend. Backend can't exist without contracts. Start with contracts.
