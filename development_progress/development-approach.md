# Development Approach Strategy
## 🎯 Master Guide for S&C Program Generator Development

### 🏆 App Vision: Performance-Focused Program Generation
**The first S&C app that generates complete periodized training programs** (not just workouts) tailored to real-life constraints. Built on science-backed principles from Supertraining, Joel Jamieson's methods, and peer-reviewed periodization research.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Program Generator**: Full periodized programs considering lifestyle, not random workouts
- **Lifestyle Integration**: Commute, work travel, equipment access, employment status
- **Performance Focus**: Trains for events/metrics, not aesthetics
- **Science-Backed**: Linear/undulating periodization from leading S&C literature
- **Universal**: Works for busy professionals to dedicated athletes

### ✅ Build Order: API-First → Backend → Frontend

Based on 2025 best practices, we follow a **contract-first** development approach.

## 📚 Table of Contents - Development Documents

### [00-essential-decisions.md](./00-essential-decisions.md) ✅ **[COMPLETE]**
**Critical decisions that affect API design**
- [✅] AI/LLM provider selection - Model-agnostic with swappable providers
- [✅] AI integration architecture - Supabase Edge Functions
- [✅] Data storage strategy - Full programs in DB, detailed logs with aggregation

**Decisions Made:**
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime)
- AI Provider: Model-agnostic (OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama via env var)
- Integration: Supabase Edge Functions with provider adapters
- Storage: Full programs in DB, detailed workout logs with aggregation

### [01-api-design.md](./01-api-design.md) ✅ **[COMPLETE]**
**API Contracts & Data Models**
- [✅] Define all REST endpoints

## 🔄 Current Status

**Active Document**: `02-database-schema.md`  
**Phase**: Database Design & Implementation  
**Next Task**: Create Supabase tables and relationships based on API contracts

---

## 📋 Development Phases

### Phase 1: API Design ✅ **COMPLETE**
Define all contracts before writing any code. This becomes our source of truth.

### Phase 2: Database & Backend ← **WE ARE HERE**
Implement the APIs and data layer based on contracts.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
Build UI that consumes the established APIs.

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
Ensure quality and deploy to production.

## 🛠️ Key Principles

1. **Contract-First**: API design drives everything
2. **No Premature Decisions**: Don't choose UI libraries until APIs are defined
3. **Sequential Progress**: Complete each phase before moving forward
4. **Documentation-Driven**: Write specs before code
5. **Test Early**: Validate APIs before frontend work

---

## ✅ Completed Prerequisites
- [x] Development environment setup
- [x] Supabase database connection
- [x] Version control (GitHub)
- [x] Project structure
- [x] Development approach defined

## 🚀 How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with** `01-api-design.md` - Define all endpoints
2. **Complete each document** sequentially
3. **Don't skip ahead** - Each phase depends on the previous
4. **Check off tasks** as you complete them
5. **Refer back here** for overall progress

**Remember**: Frontend can't exist without backend. Backend can't exist without contracts. Start with contracts.
