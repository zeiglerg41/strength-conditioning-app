# Development Approach Strategy
## 🎯 Master Guide for S&C App Development

### ✅ Build Order: API-First → Backend → Frontend

Based on 2025 best practices, we follow a **contract-first** development approach.

## 🏗️ Technical Stack & Decisions

### Core Stack
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime)
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno runtime)
- **Frontend**: React Native + Expo SDK 53
- **AI/LLM**: Model-agnostic (OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama via env var)
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

### Key Architecture Decisions
- **Development**: API-first → Backend → Frontend
- **AI Integration**: Supabase Edge Functions with provider adapters
- **Data Storage**: Full programs in DB, detailed workout logs with aggregation
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth (built-in)

## 🔄 Current Status

**Active Document**: `01-api-design.md`  
**Phase**: API Design & Contracts  
**Next Task**: Define all REST endpoints and data models

---

## 📋 Development Phases

### Phase 1: API Design ← **WE ARE HERE**
Define all contracts before writing any code. This becomes our source of truth.

### Phase 2: Database & Backend
Implement the APIs and data layer based on contracts.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
Build UI that consumes the established APIs.

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
Ensure quality and deploy to production.

## 🛠️ Key Principles

1. **Contract-First**: API design drives everything
2. **No Premature Decisions**: Don't choose UI libraries until APIs are defined
3. **Sequential Progress**: Complete each phase before moving forward
4. **Documentation-Driven**: Write specs before code
5. **Test Early**: Validate APIs before frontend work

---

## ✅ Completed Prerequisites
- [x] Development environment setup
- [x] Supabase database connection
- [x] Version control (GitHub)
- [x] Project structure
- [x] Development approach defined

## 🚀 How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with** `01-api-design.md` - Define all endpoints
2. **Complete each document** sequentially
3. **Don't skip ahead** - Each phase depends on the previous
4. **Check off tasks** as you complete them
5. **Refer back here** for overall progress

**Remember**: Frontend can't exist without backend. Backend can't exist without contracts. Start with contracts.
