# Development Progress Tracking
## Strength & Conditioning Application

## Overview
Task-oriented development progress tracking organized by technical concerns and separated by user scale. This approach focuses on **what needs to be done** rather than **when**, allowing for flexible development timing while maintaining systematic progress.

## Progress Structure

### üîß Technical Setup & Infrastructure
Core technical decisions and infrastructure setup tasks

### üì± Frontend Development  
User interface and mobile application development tasks

### üóÑÔ∏è Backend & Database
Server-side logic, database, and API development tasks

### ü§ñ AI Integration
LLM integration, prompt engineering, and AI service tasks

### üß™ Testing & Quality
Testing setup, quality assurance, and validation tasks

### üìä Monitoring & Analytics
Performance monitoring, user analytics, and system observability

## Development Documents

### [01-technical-setup.md](./01-technical-setup.md)
- Library and framework selection decisions
- Development environment configuration
- Infrastructure and hosting setup
- Third-party service integrations

### [02-frontend-development.md](./02-frontend-development.md)
- React Native setup and configuration
- UI component library integration
- Navigation and state management
- Cross-platform compatibility tasks

### [03-backend-database.md](./03-backend-database.md)  
- Supabase project setup and configuration
- Database schema design and implementation
- Authentication and authorization setup
- API endpoints and real-time features

### [04-ai-integration.md](./04-ai-integration.md)
- LLM provider selection and setup
- Prompt engineering and testing
- AI service architecture
- Cost management and optimization

### [05-testing-quality.md](./05-testing-quality.md)
- Testing framework setup
- Unit, integration, and E2E testing
- Quality assurance processes
- Performance testing and validation

### [06-monitoring-analytics.md](./06-monitoring-analytics.md)
- Error tracking and logging setup
- User analytics implementation
- Performance monitoring configuration
- Business metrics tracking

## User Scale Checkpoints

### ‚úÖ Solo Development (Just You)
Complete these tasks to have a working app for personal use:
- [ ] Basic technical setup completed
- [ ] Core features functional for single user
- [ ] Data persistence and basic UI working
- [ ] Personal validation through real usage

### ‚úÖ Small Pilot Beta (10-50 Users)
Additional tasks for small group testing:
- [ ] Multi-user testing and bug fixes
- [ ] User feedback collection systems
- [ ] Performance optimization for small groups
- [ ] Basic support and documentation

### ‚úÖ Production Scale (100+ Users)
Tasks for public launch and scaling:
- [ ] Production infrastructure and monitoring
- [ ] Advanced performance optimizations  
- [ ] Comprehensive testing and quality assurance
- [ ] Business metrics and growth tracking

## Task Completion Tracking

Each technical document contains:
- **Decision Points**: Technology choices that need to be made
- **Setup Tasks**: Configuration and installation tasks
- **Implementation Tasks**: Development work organized by feature
- **Validation Tasks**: Testing and verification steps
- **Optimization Tasks**: Performance and quality improvements

## Progress Status

Use these status indicators for each task:
- [ ] **Not Started**: Task identified but not begun
- [‚è≥] **In Progress**: Currently working on this task
- [‚ö†Ô∏è] **Blocked**: Waiting on external dependency or decision
- [‚úÖ] **Completed**: Task finished and verified working
- [üîÑ] **Needs Revision**: Completed but requires updates/fixes

## Dependency Management

Some tasks have dependencies on others. Key dependency chains:
1. **Technical Setup** ‚Üí All other development tasks
2. **Backend Database** ‚Üí Frontend Data Integration ‚Üí AI Integration
3. **Authentication** ‚Üí User Features ‚Üí Analytics
4. **Basic Features** ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Pilot Beta
5. **Monitoring** ‚Üí Production Deployment

## Usage Guidelines

### For Solo Development
Focus on completing tasks marked as **Solo Development** requirements first. These represent the minimum viable functionality.

### For Team Development  
Distribute tasks by technical area (frontend dev takes frontend tasks, backend dev takes backend tasks, etc.)

### For Milestone Planning
Group related tasks together to create development milestones. Complete all tasks in a section before moving to dependent sections.
