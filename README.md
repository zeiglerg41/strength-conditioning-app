# Strength & Conditioning Program Generator
## AI-Powered Performance Training for Real Life

### 🎯 Vision
The first S&C app that generates complete **periodized training programs** (not just workouts) tailored to your actual lifestyle. Built on science-backed principles from Supertraining, Joel Jamieson's MMA S&C methods, and peer-reviewed periodization research.

### 🏆 What Makes This Different
- **Program Generator**: Creates full periodized programs, not random workouts
- **Lifestyle Integration**: Considers commute, work travel, equipment access, employment status
- **Performance Focus**: Trains for events and performance metrics, not aesthetics  
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Adjusts based on fatigue, travel, equipment changes
- **Science-Backed**: Uses linear/undulating periodization principles from leading S&C literature
- **Universal Design**: Works for anyone - busy professionals to dedicated athletes

### 🧠 AI-Powered Adaptation
- Analyzes training age, lifestyle constraints, and goals
- Generates simulated performance events if you don't have real ones
- Adapts programs based on life changes (new job, travel, equipment access)
- Considers energy systems training alongside resistance work
- Built on swappable AI providers (OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama)

### 🔬 Evidence-Based Programming
Programs generated from principles in:
- Supertraining (Siff & Verkhoshansky)
- Joel Jamieson's S&C for MMA
- Peer-reviewed periodization research
- Linear, undulating, and conjugate method programming
