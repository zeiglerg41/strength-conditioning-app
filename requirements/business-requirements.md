# Business Requirements
## Strength & Conditioning Application

## 1. Executive Summary
### 1.1 Project Overview
An AI-powered strength and conditioning application that serves as an intelligent training coach rather than a simple workout tracker. The app leverages LLM technology to generate adaptive, periodized training programs based on sound S&C principles, user constraints, and performance goals. Unlike traditional fitness apps focused on aesthetics, this platform prioritizes performance outcomes and adapts to real-world lifestyle constraints such as travel, equipment availability, and time limitations.

### 1.2 Vision Statement
To democratize elite-level strength and conditioning coaching by making adaptive, science-based training programs accessible to athletes of all levels. The app bridges the gap between theoretical S&C knowledge and practical application, providing personalized coaching that evolves with the user's circumstances, goals, and performance progression.

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- **Performance Improvements**: Measurable gains in user-defined performance metrics (strength, power, endurance)
- **Program Adherence**: >80% completion rate of prescribed training sessions
- **User Retention**: >70% monthly active users after 6 months
- **Adaptation Effectiveness**: Successful program modifications during travel/constraint periods
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ app store rating with focus on coaching quality feedback
- **Knowledge Application**: Users demonstrate understanding of S&C principles through app interactions
