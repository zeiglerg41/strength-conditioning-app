## 💡 Key Insights

### Strengths
- Database schema is comprehensive and well-designed
- AI integration is working across multiple providers
- Mobile app has solid foundation and architecture
- Good test coverage (73 tests)
- Strong domain knowledge documented

### Gaps
- No working end-to-end user flow yet
- Backend endpoints lack business logic
- Mobile screens need to be connected to API
- Integration between layers untested

### Recommendation
Focus on completing ONE full user journey before expanding features:
1. User signs up → 2. Sets profile → 3. Generates program → 4. Views today's workout → 5. Logs exercise

This would create a minimal viable product that actually delivers value.
