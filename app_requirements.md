## Quick Reference - Key Decisions

### V1 MVP Scope (Production-Ready Core Features)
- **AI Program Generation**: Simple methodologies (linear progression + basic periodization)
- **User Management**: Manual input for demographics, constraints, and events
- **Workout Tracking**: Core metrics (main lifts, cardio, RPE-based intensity)
- **Basic Analytics**: Progress tracking and program effectiveness
- **Fatigue Override**: 30% intensity reduction, max 2 per 6 training days

### V2 Enhanced Features (Nice to Have)
- **Advanced Integrations**: Heart rate monitors, fitness platforms, GPS
- **Social Features**: Community, coaching network, achievement sharing
- **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive modeling, comparative analysis
- **Enhanced AI**: Multi-modal coaching, advanced periodization models

### Technology Approach
- **AI Strategy**: Swappable LLM architecture (API-based, provider agnostic)
- **Platform Strategy**: Mobile-first responsive web app (V1), native apps (V2)
- **Data Strategy**: Performance-first metrics with strong privacy controls
- **Development Approach**: Rapid V1 deployment with clear V2 evolution path

### Key Constraints & Considerations
- **Simplicity First**: V1 focuses on core functionality with manual inputs
- **Performance Focus**: Emphasizes measurable outcomes over aesthetics
- **Adaptive Programming**: Real-world constraint handling (travel, equipment, time)
- **Evidence-Based**: Grounded in established S&C principles and methodologies

## Next Steps

1. **Technical Review**: Have technical team review architecture and technology requirements
2. **Technology Selection**: Finalize technology stack based on team expertise and requirements
3. **MVP Planning**: Create detailed development roadmap for V1 features
4. **Research Phase**: Conduct S&C methodology research for knowledge base development
5. **Design Phase**: Create detailed UI/UX designs based on requirements specifications

## Document Maintenance

- **Business Requirements**: Update as user research and market validation progresses  
- **Technical Requirements**: Update as technology decisions are finalized
- **All Documents**: Keep synchronized as requirements evolve during development
