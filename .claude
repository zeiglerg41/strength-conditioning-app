# Claude Development Protocol
## Strength & Conditioning Application

## Core Principles
1. **One Task at a Time**: Complete exactly one checkbox from the development documents before moving to the next
2. **Follow Dependencies**: Never start a task until its dependencies are completed and verified
3. **Validate Each Step**: Confirm each task is working before marking complete
4. **Document Progress**: Update progress tracking documents as we complete tasks
5. **Stay Focused**: Resist the urge to work on multiple tasks simultaneously

## Current Development Phase
**Phase**: Solo Development - Technical Foundation
**Document**: `/development_progress/01-technical-setup.md`
**Current Section**: Development Environment Setup
**Next Task**: Code Editor Configuration - VS Code with React Native extensions

## Version Compatibility Verified ✅
- Node.js v22.16.0 ✅ (exceeds required 20+)
- React Native CLI v20.0.1 ✅ (via npx)  
- Expo CLI v0.24.20 ✅ (via npx)
- Target: Expo SDK 53 + React Native 0.79 (2025 stable)

## Task Completion Protocol
For each task:
1. **Identify**: Read the specific task from the development documents
2. **Plan**: Understand what needs to be done and any prerequisites  
3. **Execute**: Complete the task step by step
4. **Verify**: Test that the task is working as expected
5. **Document**: Mark the checkbox as complete in the appropriate document
6. **Next**: Identify the next sequential task based on dependencies

## Development Documents Reference
- **Technical Setup**: `/development_progress/01-technical-setup.md`
- **Solo Development Tasks**: `/development_progress/phase-1-solo-development.md`
- **Requirements**: `/requirements/` directory for reference

## Progress Tracking
- Use checkboxes in development documents to track completion
- Mark tasks as complete only after verification
- Update this file with current phase/section/task
- Document any deviations or issues encountered

## Commands to Remember
```bash
# Check current directory
pwd

# Check Node.js version (after installation)
node --version
npm --version

# Initialize React Native project (when ready)
npx create-expo-app --template

# Check git status
git status
```

## Current Status
- [ ] Technical Foundation: Development Environment Setup - In Progress
- [ ] Core Features: Not Started
- [ ] User Experience: Not Started  
- [ ] Validation & Testing: Not Started

## Next Immediate Task
**Task**: Install Node.js (LTS version)
**Document**: `01-technical-setup.md` - Development Environment Setup
**Verification**: Run `node --version` and `npm --version` to confirm installation
